Pages vs Workers
---
> [!warning]
> TLDR: Two different ways of hosting Sveltekit on Cloudflare -> use Workers
<!-- incremental_lists: true -->
<!-- list_item_newlines: 2 -->

Why? Workers
- have full observability
- has a vite plugin for better local development
- make it easier to add Durable Objects
- have Cron triggers
- recommended by Cloudflare over Pages
