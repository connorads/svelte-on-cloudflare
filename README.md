# Svelte on Cloudflare

Resources for a talk on deploying SvelteKit on Cloudflare Workers and layering in platform features.

- `slides/slides.md`: slide deck covering why we chose Cloudflare, the hosting trade-offs, and lessons learned.
- `DEMO.md`: step-by-step script for the live demo that scaffolds a SvelteKit project, deploys it, and adds a KV-backed counter.

Use this repo to follow along with the presentation or recreate the demo afterwards.
